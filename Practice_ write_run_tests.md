# Practice Writing and Running Tests

For this task you may select programming language, test framework, and code coverage tool. 
We provide Java and .js code. You are responsible for knowing your programming language, your framework and other tools. 


## Goals
- Practice your ability to write simple unit tests in a framework.
  - You should know how to write unit tests for a function in a class.
  - You should know how to run tests and evaluate results of the test-run.
  
- You should be able to write minimal simple test-suites that accuratly pinpoints bugs
  - Know how which tests that can be removed
- Practice running code coverage tool, and assess code coverage.
    - Find code not run during testing
    - know the differences between different code coverage measurements
- Name tests to document requirements in the SUT
  - Follow the pattern [Function]Should[Expected behaviour]For[Stimuli] 
    - Java junit: constructorShouldThrowExceptionForShortPasswords()
    - Jest:       "constructor Should Thow Exception For Short Passwords"

## Course material to support
* Developer Testing - Chapter 7 - 10
* Testing framework/tool online manuals for your framework/tools
* Course materials week 1-2

## Task 1: Write an optimized test suite
Write a test suite for the Password class provided. 

 * There are correct and buggy versions of the Password class. 
   * The correct version is defined as correct, and should not be changed.
   * The buggy versions should not be changed.
   * None of the tests you write may fail for the correct version. 
   * For each buggy version your test suite should have at least one test that failes.
   * Each test should fail for at least one buggy version which no other test fails
     * No redundant tests!
     * Example: Test A and B failes for the same buggs, so only one of them is needed
 * Add a new buggy version of Password that pass all your tests.
   * You dont need to write a test for this one. 
  
 * Artifacts to show during examination
   * Test suite as one file 
   * One assert/expect per test ( unless strong reasons )
   * You should be able to run all your tests against any of the correct, or buggy versions. 
   * You should be able to run code coverage 
   * As close to 100% test coverage for all versions of the Password as possible, (note may not always be possible)
   * Show summary as a table as below, showing coverage and pass/fail for all combinations of tests & correct and buggy versions.
   * Orally be able to answer questions about your code. All code must be fully understood.
   * Orally the reflection questions.
   * Show the buggy version of Password you wrote that pass all your tests
   * Write a test for a unknown piece of code during examination. 

### Table for checking test suite bug coverage
Create a table like this one for all the bugs and Tests, showing which test fails or succeeds for each test and the coverage. Use the table to remove tests that are redundant. You may shorten the bug-names to get a slimmer table.
